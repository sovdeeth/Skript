# Security Document
See also [code conventions](code-conventions.md); there are a few guidelines
about security of added code there.

## Reporting security issues
Security issues may be reported via the GitHub private vulnerability reporting feature [here](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/security/advisories/new).
Note that this applies *only* to security issues; everything else should still be posted to issue tracker.

Please avoid publicly posting or discussing security issues that don't have a fix available yet.

## Team guidelines
Everyone with push access must use two-factor authentication for their Github
accounts. Should their account still be compromised, other team members should
be immediately notified via Discord.
