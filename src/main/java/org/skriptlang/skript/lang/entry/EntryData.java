/**
 * EntryData is used for defining the different entries of for a {@link SectionNode}.
 * {@link org.skriptlang.skript.lang.structure.Structure}'s are a primary user of this system.
 * Take a look at this example:
 * <pre>
 * command /example: # this is the SectionNode
 *   description: this is an example of an entry
 *   trigger: # this is also an example of an entry
 *     # code goes here (not entry data!)
 * </pre>
 * From the above, it can be seen that EntryData is found at the level immediately after a {@link SectionNode}.
 * It can also be seen that entries come in many forms.
 * In fact, all entries are based upon a {@link Node}.
 * This could be something like a {@link ch.njol.skript.config.SimpleNode} or {@link SectionNode},
 *  but it may also be something totally different.
 * Every entry data class must define a validator-type method for {@link Node}s, along with
 *  a method of obtaining a value from that {@link Node}.
 * Every entry data instance must contain some sort of key. This key is the main identifier
 *  of an entry data instance within a {@link EntryValidator}.
 * @param <T> The type of the value returned by this entry data.
