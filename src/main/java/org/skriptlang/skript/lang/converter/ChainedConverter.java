/**
 * A Chained Converter is very similar to a regular {@link Converter}.
 * They are used when it is not possible to directly convert from Type A to Type B.
 * Instead, a "middle man" is used that makes it possible to convert from Type A to Type B.
 * What this means is that Type A is converted to the "middle man" type.
 * Then, that "middle man" type is converted to Type B.
 *
 * Of course, multiple Chained Converters can be chained together to provide far more conversion possibilities.
 * In these cases, you might have, for example, another "middle man" between
 *  this Chained Converter's Type A and "middle man"
 *
 * By using conversion chains, Skript can convert an object into a different type that seemingly has no relation.
 *
 * @param <F> The type to convert from.
 * @param <M> A middle type that is needed for converting 'from' to 'to'.
 *                'from' will be converted to this type, and then this type will be converted to 'to'.
 * @param <T> The type to convert to.
