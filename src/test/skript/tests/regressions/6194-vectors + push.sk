test "normalize zero vector":
	set {_vector} to vector(0,0,0)
	add 1 to vector length of {_vector}
	assert {_vector} is vector(0,0,0) with "add to zero vector's length failed"

	set vector length of {_vector} to 1
	assert {_vector} is vector(0,0,0) with "set zero vector's length failed"

	assert normalize {_vector} is vector(0,0,0) with "normalize zero vector failed"
