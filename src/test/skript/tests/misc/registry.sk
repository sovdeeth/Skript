	# Test namespaced keys
	assert curse of vanishing = minecraft:vanishing_curse with "'curse of vanishing' enchant should match namespace key"

	# Test serialization
	set {test::enchantment} to minecraft:sharpness
	assert {test::enchantment} = sharpness with "variable should have been set to sharpness enchantment"
